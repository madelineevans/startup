[My Notes](notes.md)

I changed this.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Pickleball has been taking over the nation and thousands of people have begun playing the sport. But what if you don't have anyone to play with or want to meet new people? Thats where (insert app name here) comes into play. This app helps you connect with other pickleball players based on a variety of factors to help you find a well matched player, follow your friends, or just find people nearby to play with!

### Design

![Design image](public/PageOutline.png)

### Key features

- Authentication/secure login
- Shows you other pickleball players (and courts??) around you actively playing
- A ranking system that starts off based on an intro survey you fill out and continues based on game scores and other's reviews of you
- Shows you other players you might want to play with based on ranking's and locations
- A chat function that allows you to communicate with other players
- A way to follow other players (and recieve updates of their games? Or if actively playing?)

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Correct HTML structure. A login page, create account page, a page with a map for you to find players nearby, a page for connecting with other players, a chat page.
- **CSS** - Looks pretty, works on different screens/devices.
- **React** - Lets you login, lets you follow or look at other players, record games/rate players and other react routing components.
- **Service** - Match algorithm, login/logout authentication, storing recorded game, and send chat.
- **DB/Login** - Stores recorded games, chat history, social networks, and login info.
- **WebSocket** - Live chat functionality, live locations, and reminders/friend updates (if time).
